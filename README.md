# Cassava_leaf_disease_classification
The Kaggle dataset consists of approximately 21,637 images of various diseases in Cassava leaves. The data is divided into 5 categories. The 4 categories represent different types of diseases and the fifth category represents the healthy leaf.
As the datset is observed to be imbalanced so a method of image augmentation is applied to balance the set.
The balanced set is fed to the trained model Inception v3 for training and predicting the probabilities of appearance of the test images w.r.t. classes.
